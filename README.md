Swift Constructs for Java Programmers, Playgrounds explaining the featues

Swift is a programming language from Apple which is intended to replace the Objective-C programming language. Swift is a strongly typed language with object oriented constructs. It can be used to write both Functional and Object oriented style programming. 

The programming constructs are very simple, concise and easy to read and understand. It make code more readable with clear constructs. Though its a new programming language Apple made sure that the earlier f/w's written in objective-c to be used in tandem with Swift coding. 

> You can use old libraries written in Objective-C in swift, but you cannot write Objective-C syntax in a swift file. 

For a high level overview of the swift constructs look here [Contents.swift](https://github.com/bsharathchand/swift4java/blob/master/iOSPlayground.playground/Contents.swift)

I will try adding more specific playgrounds as and when I explore more on this.

Happy Coding...
